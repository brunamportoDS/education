# Education — Project Skeleton

## Purpose
One‑sentence purpose placeholder: Analyze educational opportunity gaps using public datasets and simple exploratory data analysis.

## Project Structure
```
education/
├─ data/                  # Raw and processed data
├─ code/                  # Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts
├─ reports/               # Generated reports and visualizations
├─ requirements.txt       # Dependencies
└─ README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Data
- **EdGap_data.xlsx** — From the DATA 5100 GitHub repository (Education Gap dataset). *(Insert link here to the specific file in GitHub — use the Raw URL if downloading with `curl`.)*
- **ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv** — From the provided Dropbox link. *(Insert link here.)*
- **Personalization data (optional):** Add and list any additional sources used to personalize your analysis. Include links and brief descriptions.

## Getting Started
1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch JupyterLab, open `code/Education.ipynb`, and start exploring.

## Notes
- Keep raw files unchanged in `data/`. If you create cleaned/processed versions, save them with clear names (e.g., `*_clean.csv`) in the same folder.
- Update this README with a fuller description and findings as your project evolves.
